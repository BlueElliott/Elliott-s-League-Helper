# Elliott's League Helper - Project Status

**Last Updated:** January 31, 2026
**Repository:** https://github.com/BlueElliott/Elliott-s-League-Helper

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

A lightweight, ad-free League of Legends companion app that automatically imports runes and item builds.

**Goals:**
- 50-80MB RAM (vs 400-600MB competitors)
- <70ms response time with caching
- No ads, no bloat, no Overwolf
- Multi-source support (U.GG, OP.GG, Lolalytics)

---

## ✅ What's Working

### Core Infrastructure (Milestone 1 - ~80% Complete)
- ✅ **LCU Connector** ([src/lcu/connector.py](src/lcu/connector.py))
  - Auto-detects League client via lockfile and process detection
  - Handles authentication with self-signed SSL certificates
  - REST API wrapper for LCU endpoints

- ✅ **WebSocket Handler** ([src/lcu/websocket.py](src/lcu/websocket.py))
  - Real-time event listening for champion select
  - Successfully detects champion locks
  - Event-driven architecture working

- ✅ **LCU API Wrapper** ([src/lcu/api.py](src/lcu/api.py))
  - Rune page management (create, delete, apply)
  - Champion select session tracking
  - Summoner info retrieval

- ✅ **Rune Manager** ([src/runes/manager.py](src/runes/manager.py))
  - Ready to apply rune pages via LCU API
  - Auto-cleanup of old temp pages
  - Tested and functional (when data is available)

- ✅ **Item Set Writer** ([src/items/writer.py](src/items/writer.py))
  - File-based item set creation
  - Supports Summoner's Rift and ARAM formats
  - Auto-detects League installation path

- ✅ **Project Setup**
  - Modular architecture with proper separation
  - Windows compatibility fixes
  - Git repository linked to GitHub
  - All dependencies installed

## ❌ Current Blocker: U.GG API Access Denied

### The Problem
```
URL: https://stats2.u.gg/lol/1.5/overview/14_1/ranked_solo_5x5/20/middle/1.5.0.json
Response: 403 Access Denied
Error: <Error><Code>AccessDenied</Code><Message>Access Denied</Message>
```

**Impact:** Cannot fetch rune/item build data from U.GG

**Root Cause:** U.GG has blocked direct API access. The endpoint format we used based on research is being rejected.

### Attempted Solutions
- ✅ Added debug logging to see exact URLs
- ✅ Verified champion detection works
- ✅ Confirmed LCU connection works
- ❌ Direct API calls blocked by U.GG

### Next Steps to Fix
1. **Web Scraping Approach**: Scrape U.GG website HTML instead of API
2. **Alternative Data Source**: Use Community Dragon or Riot Data Dragon
3. **Reverse Engineer**: Find actual U.GG API endpoints used by their site
4. **User Agent Headers**: Try mimicking browser requests

## 🔴 Not Yet Implemented

### Milestone 2: Item Sets (50% Complete)
- ✅ File writer implemented

- ❌ Auto-refresh on patch change
- ❌ 95%+ cache hit rate target

### Milestone 4: Multi-Source Support (0% Complete)
- ❌ OP.GG scraper/provider
- ❌ Lolalytics scraper/provider
- ❌ User preference settings
- ❌ Source selection UI
- ❌ Fallback logic when one source fails

### Milestone 5: User Interface (0% Complete)

- ❌ Status indicators
- ❌ Visual feedback (currently console only)
- ❌ Optional: Flask web UI

## 🧪 Testing Results

### What We Verified Works
```
[OK] Connected to League client
[OK] WebSocket connected
[OK] Champion detection (Champion ID 113 = Sejuani, ID 20 = Nunu)
[OK] Role detection (middle, jungle, etc.)
```

### What Failed
```
[FAILED] Failed to fetch build data from U.GG
Reason: 403 Access Denied on API endpoint
```

### Test Process
1. App starts and connects to League client ✅
2. Detects when you enter champion select ✅
3. Fires event when champion is locked ✅
4. Attempts to fetch build data ❌ (403 error)
5. Would apply runes if data was available ⏸️ (untested)

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies (already done)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
python -u run.py

# Or run with debugging
python -u run.py
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- App connects to League client
- Listens for champion selections
- Currently fails at data fetching step (403 error)

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **[CRITICAL] U.GG API Returns 403**
   - Status: Blocking
   - Impact: Cannot fetch rune/item data
   - Solution: Need to implement web scraping or find alternative API

2. **No GUI**
   - Status: Not implemented
   - Impact: Console-only, no visual feedback
   - Solution: Implement Milestone 5

3. **Champion Names Incomplete**
   - Status: Hardcoded partial list
   - Impact: Shows "Champion113" instead of "Sejuani"
   - Solution: Integrate Data Dragon API for full champion data

4. **No Caching**
   - Status: Not implemented
   - Impact: Would be slow even if data fetching worked
   - Solution: Implement Milestone 3

5. **Summoner Name Shows Empty**
   - Status: Minor
   - Impact: Displays "Welcome, !" instead of username
   - Solution: Might be normal when not logged into account

## 📊 Progress Summary

**Overall Progress:** ~25% Complete

| Milestone | Status | Completion |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| 1. MVP Core | 🟡 Partial | 80% (blocked by data) |
| 2. Item Sets | 🟡 Partial | 50% |
| 3. Caching | 🔴 Not Started | 0% |
| 4. Multi-Source | 🔴 Not Started | 0% |
| 5. UI/Polish | 🔴 Not Started | 0% |

**Key Achievement:** The LCU integration is solid. Once data fetching works, runes will auto-apply.

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Data Fetching
Choose one approach:
1. **Web Scraping**: Scrape U.GG HTML using BeautifulSoup
2. **Community Dragon**: Use https://raw.communitydragon.org
3. **Alternative APIs**: Research other data sources

### Priority 2: Test Rune Application
Once data is available:
1. Verify runes actually apply to client
2. Test with multiple champions
3. Confirm rune pages show up in-game

### Priority 3: Add Basic GUI
- System tray icon
- On/off toggle
- Status indicator

## 💡 Notes for Continuation

When you come back to this project:

1. **First, fix the data provider:**
   - Check [src/providers/ugg.py](src/providers/ugg.py)
   - Either implement web scraping or use alternative API
   - Test with: `python -u run.py` and lock a champion

2. **Then verify rune application:**
   - Make sure runes actually show up in League client
   - Check if they persist between champion swaps

3. **Finally, add features:**
   - Implement caching for speed
   - Add more data sources
   - Build a GUI for better UX

**Current Command to Test:**
```bash
python -u run.py
# Then lock a champion in League client
# Watch console for debug output
```

---

**Good luck!** The foundation is solid - just need to solve the data fetching problem. 🚀
